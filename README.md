Abstract: _The Landau-Lifshitz equation provides an efficient way to account for the effects of radiation reaction without acquiring the non-physical solutions typical for the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation. We solve the Landau-Lifshitz equation in its covariant four-vector form in order to control both the energy and momentum of radiating particle. Our study reveals that implicit time-symmetric collocation methods of the Runge-Kutta-Nyström type are superior in both accuracy and better maintaining the mass-shell condition than their explicit counterparts. We carry out an extensive study of numerical accuracy by comparing the analytical and numerical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz equation. Finally, we present the results of simulation of particles scattering by a focused laser pulse. Due to radiation reaction, particles are less capable for penetration into the focal region, as compared to the case of radiation reaction neglected. Our results are important for designing the forthcoming experiments with high intensity laser fields._
